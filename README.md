# Data698

This is a github repo for my Data 698 / capstone project for CUNY's data science master's degree program 

The study attempts to create a geo-spatial model for auto accident occurrences based on traffic citations using data from Montgomery county in Maryland.

Files for the final presentation flask app can be found in the Data698_flask_app repository.
